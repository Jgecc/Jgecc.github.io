            <P>I have right now only a few of my Websites here. My other projects will come soon. One of my big Project is to make this Website great but it will probably take some time.
                </br> Here is the version number of the Website -> 0.0.3</P>
            <div>Projects:</div>
            <p>Here I first learned to code websites so don't judge me on it please. Because of that there are some parts wich are similar to the tutorial.
                </br>My goal is to make a site about Ducks because these animals are fucking <strong>amzing</strong>. But untli this happends it is trash.
